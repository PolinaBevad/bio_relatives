## Requirements
* To run bio_relatives project:
    * Java 8 JDK or higher
* To build bio_relatives project:
    * Java 8 JDK or higher
    * Git 2.5 or higher
    * Gradle 3.1 or higher. We recommend using the `./gradlew` script, which will
          download and use an appropriate gradle version automatically (see examples below).
## Installing

You can download the latest version of the project from [github releases page](https://github.com/PolinaBevad/bio_relatives/releases).

## Building

bio_relatives project can be built using [gradle](http://gradle.org/).

A wrapper script `./gradlew` will download the appropriate version of the gradle on the first invocation.

Examples of gradle usage from the bio_relatives root directory:
 - compile and build a jar 
 ```
 ./gradlew
 ```
 or
 ```
 ./gradlew jar
 ```
 The jar file will be in `build/libs/bio_relatives-\<version\>.jar`. Version is based on the current git commit.

 - run tests
 ```
 ./gradlew test
```
 - clean project directory
 ```
 ./gradlew clean
 ```

 - build a jar file that includes all of bio_relatives's dependencies
 ```
 ./gradlew shadowJar
 ```
 
 - create a snapshot and install it into your local maven repository
 ```
 ./gradlew install
 ```

 - for an exhaustive list of all available targets
 ```
 ./gradlew tasks
 ```

### Creation of the project using IntelliJ
To create the project in IntelliJ IDE for bio_relatives do the following:

1. Select fom the menu: `File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources`
2. In the resulting dialog, chose `Import from existing model`, select `Gradle` and `Next`
3. Choose the `default gradle wrapper` and `Finish`.

## Running integration tests
To run the integration tests, go to the `src/test/bash/`. If you need to test Levenshtein comparison, then run the script `levenstein_comparison_test.sh` the usual way(the script does not require any arguments): `./levenshtein_comparison_test.sh`.
If you need to test STR comparison, then run the script `str_comparison_test.sh` with argument `X`(for X-STR comparison) or `Y`(for Y-STR comparison). For example, `./str_comparison_test Y`. The output of each test can be found in the `src/test/bash/output/` folder. You can see the expected test results in the `src/test/bash/expected/` folder. You can see the difference between the test and expected data in the `src/test/bash/output` 

## Usage
    java -jar bio_relatives.jar [-h | --help] [-io | --intermediateOutput] [-g | --graph <path to the file>] [-c2 | --compare2 <first> <second> <bed>] [-c3 | --compare3 <father> <mother> <son> <bed>] [-m | --mode <L | XY>] [-th | --threadsNumber <number>]
### Options

`-h`, `--help` - show help message.

`-io`, `--intermediateOutput` - key, which enables intermediate results output.

`-c2`, `--compare2` - compare genomes of two persons.

`-c3`, `--compare3` - compare genomes of three persons (father/mother/son).

`-m`, `--mode` - defines which comparator will be used.

`-g`, `--graph` - defines whether graph should be printed or not (used only in STR comparison).

`-th`, `--threadsNumber` - defines number of threads that should be created to process the information analysis.

### Examples
#### Comparison of the genomes of two persons
```
java -jar bio_relatives.jar --compare2 ~/path/to/first.bam ~/path/to/second.bam ~/path/to/file.bed
```
#### Comparison of the genomes of three persons
```
java -jar bio_relatives.jar --compare3 ~/path/to/father.bam ~/path/to/mother.bam ~/path/to/son.bam ~/path/to/file.bed
```
#### Comparison of the genomes with intermediate output
```
java -jar bio_relatives.jar -io -c2 ~/path/to/first.bam ~/path/to/second.bam ~/path/to/file.bed
```
